# Bayesian_Quark_Helicity

This project is created by Josh Tawabutr as part of Physics 8820: <i>Learning from data: Bayesian methods and (some) machine learning</i> at the Ohio State University in autumn semester 2021. 

Please see the Jupyter notebook for project details and the comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough of all the work. The physics background of the project can be found at [arXiv:1511.06737](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06737), [arXiv:1808.09010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09010) and [arXiv:2005.07285](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07285).
